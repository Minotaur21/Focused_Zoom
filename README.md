# Focused Zoom
A mod for Stalker Anomaly that allows you to zoom when holstered and gives you an extra bit of oomph when aiming, sort of but not exactly like the feature in Arma 3 and DayZ.

REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(If you're playing EFP 2.5/EFP 3.0 you don't need the two required mods!)
- Requirement #1: Mod Configuration Menu - https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/anomaly-mod-configuration-menu
- Requirement #2: Adjustable Scope View - https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/adjustable-scope-view
I suggest installing those two mods using a mod manager like Mod Organizer, but if you're feeling lazy you can just drop their gamedata folders into your Anomaly folder.
Install my mod the same way, with a mod manager or by dropping my mod's gamedata folder into your Anomaly folder. None of these mods are likely to conflict with any other mods.

WHAT DOES THIS MOD DO?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When your weapon is holstered or unequipped, you can zoom in by pressing whatever key you have Weapon-Zoom bound to (`Right Mouse Button` for most people).
When you're aiming with a weapon, you can bring the sight/scope closer to you and/or gain a bit of zoom by pressing whatever key you have Use-Activate bound to (`F` for most people).

WHY DO YOU NEED THIS?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- It's not *needed*, you old fart. Yes we all know, in real life your eyes aren't binoculars and you can't zoom-in your vision like a cyborg.
But this mod isn't meant to simulate real life. It's meant to provide some convenience when you're exploring in the Zone.
- Who has the patience to pull their binoculars out every time they want to take a small glance down the road? Or when they want to marvel at the mayhem?
- The mod is called Focus for a reason, imagine your character tuning out all the nonsense around him and getting tunnel vision as he concentrates on what's in front of him.

The mod comes with an MCM, meaning you can tweak the various settings in-game. Personally I stick with the Holster Focus zoom for convenience and I like the Closer Aim Sights setting.
Some people have requested Aim Focus zoom, so I added that as well. The settings are clearly labeled and hovering your mouse over them will tell you what to do.

FUTURE PLANS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- I eventually want to incorporate stamina loss while Focusing. I'll need to play around with it until I find a reasonable way to do this.
- Also, at some point I want to add compatibility for XCVB's Weapon Sway mod and Grok's Body Health, so that Focusing while aiming reduces sway effects.
- Feel free to fork this mod. I recommend checking out Sneaky's Adjustable Scope script for inspiration, as I have.

RECOMMENDED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shader Based 2D Scopes - https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/shader-based-2d-scopes-151dx11engine-mod
^^ This is an excellent alternative to PiP Scopes (which some people call 3D scopes). PiP scopes kill fps in Anomaly, the game isn't designed to handle them well.
The Shader Based 2D Scopes mod provides a fresh experience and all the 2D scopes you used to laugh at will suddenly come to life. Please note that Shader Based 2D only works in DX10/DX11.

If you don't wanna install Adjustable Scopes or MCM and want a simpler way to get similar features, check out SlowVibe's mod!

KNOWN ISSUES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Some 3d-model scopes such as the AUG scope and the SUSAT don't have any Aim Focus zoom available. The Closer Aim Sights feature still works for them. Let me know if you have suggestions on how to implement additional zoom for those scopes.
- Not an issue per se, but 2D scopes don't have any effects applied to them. Never intended to support 2D scopes. I recommend getting the "Shader Based 2D Scopes" mod I linked above.
